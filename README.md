# Revert to original firmware
Daniel Thompson
"You will need to revert back to SoftDevice 5 and have a copy of the original firmware. I can help with the first bit but I didn't make any firmware backup (and couldn't legally share it even if I had) so I am not able to provide a copy of the original firmware. Anyhow, if you do have a backup then note that the zip updates in DaFlasherFiles cannot be applied directly to wasp-bootloader but we can return to the DaFlasher bootloaders by installing https://github.com/fanoush/ds-d6/blob/master/micropython/DS-D6-adafruit-back-to-desay-sd132v201.zip followed by ATCdfuFromSD2toSD5.zip . If you don't have a backup and decided you didn't like wasp-os then perhaps you could try ATCwatch to see if you like that better!"
